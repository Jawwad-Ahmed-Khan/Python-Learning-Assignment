## Problem Statement

Write a program that doubles each element in a list of numbers. For example, if you start with this list:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

You should end with this list:

numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
