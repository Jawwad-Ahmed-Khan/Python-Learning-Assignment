## Problem Statement

Implement an 'eraser' on a canvas. 

The canvas consists of a grid of blue 'cells' which are drawn as rectangles on the screen. We then create an eraser rectangle which, when dragged around the canvas, sets all of the rectangles it is in contact with to white.

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
