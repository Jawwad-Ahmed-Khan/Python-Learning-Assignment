## Problem Statement

Fill out the function get_first_element(lst) which takes in a list lst as a parameter and prints the first element in the list. The list is guaranteed to be non-empty. We've written some code for you which prompts the user to input the list one element at a time.

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
