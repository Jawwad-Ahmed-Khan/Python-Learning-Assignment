## Problem Statement

Write a program which continuously asks the user to enter values which are added one by one into a list. When the user presses enter without typing anything, print the list.

Here's a sample run (user input is in blue):

Enter a value: 1 
Enter a value: 2 
Enter a value: 3 
Enter a value: 
Here's the list: ['1', '2', '3']

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
