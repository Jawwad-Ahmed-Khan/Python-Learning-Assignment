## Problem Statement

In this program we show an example of using dictionaries to keep track of information in a phonebook.

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
