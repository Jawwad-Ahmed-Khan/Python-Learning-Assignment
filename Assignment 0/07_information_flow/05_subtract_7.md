## Problem Statement

Fill out the subtract_seven helper function to subtract 7 from num, and fill out the main() method to call the subtract_seven helper function! If you're stuck, revisit the add_five example from lecture.

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
